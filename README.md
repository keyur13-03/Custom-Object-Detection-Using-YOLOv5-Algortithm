# Custom-Object-Detection-Using-YOLOv5-Algortithm
The prime reason to develop automation in agriculture is to save the time and energy required to do an agricultural-related task and enlarge production by serving each crop individually. In Saskatchewan, most of the farmers are associated with canola farming. Detecting canola at a very early stage can improve the production of canola.YOLOv5 algorithm performed object detection in a single neural network and predicted bounding boxes and with class probabilities in one evaluation. YOLOv5 algorithm is an unified architecture, which frames object detection as a regression problem and optimizes end-to-end detection. The accuracy of the YOLOv5 algorithm is very high and it is much faster compared to other object detection algorithms.
